    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Shian', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way 
    //使用slice方法切片

    const team1 =  players.slice()
    team1[3] = 'Alec'
    console.log(players, team1)

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team2 = [].concat(players)
    team2[3] = 'Alec'
    console.log(players, team2)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team3 = [...players]
    team3[3] = 'Alec'
    console.log(players, team3)

    // 使用Array创建新的数组实例

    const team4 = Array.from(players)
    team4[3] = 'Alec'
    console.log(players, team4)
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Shian Gee',
      age: 21
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // const p1 = person;
    // p1['age'] = 18;
    // console.log(person, p1)

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const p2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 18 })
    // p2.age = 18;
    console.log(person, p2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    //借助json

    const json = JSON.stringify(person)
    // console.log(json)
    const p3 = JSON.parse(json)
    p3.age = 18
    console.log(person, p3)
